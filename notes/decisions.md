# Decisions

Running log, newest at the bottom. DESIGN.md gets assembled from these at the
end — writing the reasoning down once, when it is fresh, beats reconstructing it
on the last evening.

One entry per decision that a reviewer could reasonably have made differently.
Not every choice needs an entry; the ones with a real cost do.

## D1 — Windows-native build as the primary path

**Options considered**

1. Docker container (linux/amd64) as the only supported path.
2. Native Windows with MSVC, container kept as a documented fallback.
3. WSL2 with the Linux binary.

**Chosen:** 2.

**Why:** the package ships `bin\swarm_sim.exe`, so the native path has the
fewest moving parts and no emulation layer between me and the simulator. Docker
Desktop may not even be installed, and installing it costs an hour I do not
have tonight.

**Cost accepted:** I need MSVC (or MinGW) on the machine, and the build is not
reproducible on a machine that lacks it. The container files stay in the repo so
that fallback is one command away, but they are no longer the tested path — if I
ever need them, expect to spend time revalidating them.

## D2 — Hostile discriminant: sure-hit or shrink, not a 24 m gate

**Options considered**

1. Tighten `asset_radius · 0.8` (24 m) to a smaller fraction.
2. Require miss to be shrinking, with no sure-hit clause.
3. Sure-hit (`miss < 5 m`) **or** miss has dropped ≥ 3 m since first sight while still inside `asset_radius`.

**Chosen:** 3. Implemented as `AimedAtAsset` in `belief.cpp`; `Classify` latches `Track.miss_at_first`.

**Why:** The 24 m gate is what called civilians `enemy` before t=8 on s1 (entities 22 and 24). Alignment and closing look identical for a near-miss chord and an aimed dash; CPA miss is the discriminant, but a static radius that is 80% of the asset still accepts ~16% of civilian chords. Tightening the fraction (option 1) still calls any chord inside the new radius. Shrink-only (option 2) rejects s1 hostiles, who spawn already aimed at the origin so their miss never shrinks from zero. Option 3 is the comment already on `ClosestApproachDistance`.

**Cost accepted:** A civilian whose chord misses by less than 5 m still looks like a dash. First-sight CPA is noisier than `fix_sigma` because it extrapolates velocity, so a 3 m drop can fire on a constant chord when `asset_radius` is small (generated x2-a is 20.6 m). Sweep after the change: `pair_neutral` gone on 6/8 scenarios; remains on x1-a (1, miss 5.3 m) and x2-a (2, miss 6.2 m and 18 m). Policy commit and the 4 m separation margin were left alone.
